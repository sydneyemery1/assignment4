# A2: U.S. COVID Trends

## Overview
In many ways, we have come to understand the gravity and trends in the COVID-19 pandemic through data. Regardless of media source, people are consuming more epidemiological information than ever, primarily through reported figures, charts, and maps.

This assignment is your opportunity to work directly with the same data used by the [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/). While the analysis is guided through a series of questions, it is your opportunity to use programming skills to ask more detailed questions about the pandemic.

## Getting Started
You should start this assignment by opening up the `analysis.R` script. The script will guide you through an initial analysis of the data.

* **Coding prompts.** Complete the coding prompts in `analysis.R`. You MUST use the `dplyr` package.

* **Reflection prompts.** Throughout `analysis.R`, there are prompts labeled `"Reflection"`. Please write at least 1-3 sentences for each of these prompts below in this `README.md` file. As appropriate, provide evidence, give justification for your opinions, or genuinely reflect on your views. Please strive for concise, clear, and interesting writing.

## Reflection 1
Before actually calculating the total number of COVID cases and deaths, record your guesses for the following questions.

Guess: How many total COVID cases do you think there have been in the U.S.?
I think that there has been 50 million cases in the U.S.

Guess: How many total COVID-related deaths do you think there have been in the U.S.?
I think that there have been 1 million COVID-related deaths in the U.S.

Guess: Which state do you think has the highest number of COVID cases, and which state do you think has the lowest?
I think that New York has the highest number of cases and I think that California had the lowest.

## Reflection 2
Did the number of COVID cases and deaths surprise you? Why or why not? What about the states with the highest and lowest number of cases? How did your guesses line up with the actual results? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
I wasn't surprised by the number of cases and deaths. I wasn't surprised by this because the number of
a little over 1 million deaths and over 100 million cases because of the severity that COVID has had
over the past few years. My guesses were off as California had the highest number of cases and Washington had the fewest number of cases.

## Reflection 3
Which county has the highest number of cases in the state of Washington, and does it surprise you? Why or why not? (You may need to google this county to learn about it) Answer at least in 1-3 sentences
The county in Washington with the highest number of cases is King county. This doesn't surprise me since King county has the largest number of residents. 

## Reflection 4
Why are there so many observations (counties) in the variable `lowest_deaths_in_each_state`? That is, wouldn't you expect the number to be around 50? Why is the number greater than 50? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
I would think that there are as many as there are, being more than 50, aligning with one county with 
the lowest deaths for each state, because some states ended up having counties with the same numbers
in terms of deaths, allowing for a tie between counties for the lowest death numbers.

## Reflection 5
What do you think about the number and scale of the inconsistencies in the data? Does the fact that there are inconsistencies mean that people should not use this data? Why or why not? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
The number and the scale of the inconsistencies in the data suggests that there is variation among
the data being referenced. This could be due to how the data was gathered in the first place with perhaps there being a lack of consistency or miscommunication between those that were tasked with recording all of the data at the time of the data occurring. I think that the data is still viable because the differences are not large numbers. 

## Reflection 6
Why were you interested in this particular question? Were you able to answer your question with code? What did you learn? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
I was interested in this particular question because at the beginning of just about when the pandemic started, I was curious to know if January saw that there were any cases being diagnosed. What I learned was that this was still too early into the pandemic for people to be getting diagnosed. 

## Reflection 7
What, if anything, made you curious about this COVID analysis? What, if anything, surprised you? What might you do the same or differently on your next data wrangling project? Answer in at least 1-3 sentences
What made me interested in this analysis was how there were areas that I didn't expect to be so impacted by COVID as they actually were. I thought it was eye opening to see the impact that COVID had in communities that I otherwise wouldn't have been aware of.
